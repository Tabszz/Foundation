                <p align="center">Our main goal is to help those that are less fortunate by any means possible. We aim to grow as a foundation and grow our reach aswel. <strong>The goal</strong> is not only 
                limited to Kenya or Africa, this is just our starting point. We started close to home because <em><strong>charity begins at home</strong></em>. My hope is reach the crevices and 
                dark corners of the earth and to offer a helping hand. We are currently focused on providing nutrition and we will later implemant workshops. We believe a well honed skill 
                could open doorways for you and your beloved. In the near future we are also looking into building an asylum for homeless and those who could not help themselves. Our outreach to people is not only to provide food but also
                to change the lives of people. I believe everyone should also have access to a medical facility or medical help whenever necessary. In the future i can see this organisation 
                helping with providing life saving surgeries to those in need and possibly the opportunity to provide prosthetics, althoughfor now this is just the vision.

                <p>This cause first started as a simple idea from my mother; Esther her intentions were to help relatives struggling in Kenya. While living in Belgium 
                would ask for contributions from family members, colleagues, employers and others.
                I later questioned my mother, "why are we limiting our help to only our family?" This caused a shift in our mindset and we decided to help whoever we could help.
                Our current focus is on villages and tribes living close to home. We started from close due to understanding that <em><strong>charity begins at home</strong></em>.
                Due to <em>limited resources</em> we rely on family in Kenya to do their part whilst we collect and contribute to the cause. We have reached several families in various villages in the county 
                Murang'a.</strong></p>

                <p>In the past we've recieved help from other charity organisation like:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Unicef</li>
                        <li>Africa Mission</li>
                        <li>Red Cross</li>
                    </ul>
            
                    <ol>
                        <li>Unicef</li>
                        <li>Africa Mission</li>
                        <li>Red Cross</li>
                    </ol>
                
                Help came in a lot of different ways i.e. provision of foods and substances, hygene products, transportation of
                these products and financial support as well.</P>
